# Graph Compatative Programing

## Content

1. [Implement graph](ImplementGraph_1.java)
    - Metrix Implementation
    - Points to graph implementation

2. Graph Traversal
    - [Breadth First Search](Traverse_BFS_2.java)
        - Metrix Traverse
        - Points graph traverse
    - [Depth First Search](Traverse_DFS_3.java)
        - Metrix Traverse
        - Points graph traverse
    - Problem:
        - Find min edges distance (BFS)
        - Deapth is high, find live member in family tree (DFS)
        - Family tree, parant who died early (BFS)
        - Deapth check or longest deapth (DFS)
        - Sortest Path (BFS)
        - Maze, Sudoku

3. Graph connected/unconnected component
    - [DFS](ConnectedGraph_3.java)
    - [BFS](ConnectedGraph_3.java)
    - Union Find (Only for undirected graph)

4. [Union Find undirected graph *TBD](UnionFind_4.java)
    - Find Cycle
    - count component

5. Cycle Detection
    - Undirected Graph
        - BFS
        - DFS
        - Union Disjoint Set (Covered in 4)
    - Directed graph
        - BFS
        - DFS
